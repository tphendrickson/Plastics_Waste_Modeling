Public repository for data and code used in Hendrickson et al. 2024 "Paths to Circularity for Plastics in the United States"

Primary data and analysis for the materials flow analysis (MFA, baseline flow) and the Bandwidth assessment are the "MFA_files" folder. Note that all data purchased from American Chemistry Council in the MFA has been REMOVED. We've highlighted all instances where the ACC data is needed for the model to function.

Geospatial analysis coding is in the "MRF_Mapping" folders, excluding any data purchased.
